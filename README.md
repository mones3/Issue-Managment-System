# IssueManager
An issue tracking system

Designed, implemented, and tested this issue tracking system. Provides an overview of all bugs and enhancements in a project and the projectâ€™s current status. This application implements a finite-state machine (FSM), which allows the user to edit and update the issues accordingly.

Worked across the development lifecycle to build and maintain code, eliminating various bugs.
